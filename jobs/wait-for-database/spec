description: >
  This is a pre-start job to delay starting the rest of the role until a
  database connection is ready.  Currently it only checks that a response can
  be obtained from the server, and not that it responds intelligently.

templates:
  pre-start.erb: bin/pre-start

consumes:
- name: database
  type: database
  optional: true

properties:
  wait-for-database.hostname:
    description: >
      The host name of the database to wait for.  If not set, this will be
      looked up via a `database` BOSH link instead.
  wait-for-database.port:
    description: The port of the database to wait for.
